# LeetCode Solution Bot

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based chatbot that provides solutions to LeetCode problems using a custom knowledge base.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Answers LeetCode problems using a custom knowledge base
- Maintains conversation history
- Uses Groq's LLM for generating responses
- Processes and retrieves information from PDF documents

## ðŸ›  How It Works

### Document Processing
- Loads your `Leetcode.pdf` file containing solutions
- Splits the document into manageable chunks
- Converts text into numerical vectors (embeddings) for efficient searching

### Query Handling
- Searches through document chunks when you ask a question
- Finds the most relevant sections containing similar information
- Uses these sections as context for generating accurate answers

### Response Generation
- Uses Groq's LLM to generate responses
- Strictly uses only the provided document context
- Clearly indicates when information isn't available in the knowledge base

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key
- LeetCode solutions in PDF format
